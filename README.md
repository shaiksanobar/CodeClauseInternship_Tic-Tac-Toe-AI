🎯 Features

· Smart AI Opponent with multi-layered decision logic
· Strategic Gameplay (Win > Block > Random move priority)
· Clean ASCII Interface for easy visualization
· Input Validation and error handling
· Win/Tie Detection for all possible combinations
· Multiple Game Sessions support

🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites

· Python 3.x

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeClauseInternship_object_detection_system.git
```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CodeClauseInternship_object_detection_system
```

1. Run the game:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe_ai.py
```

🎮 How to Play

1. You play as X, AI plays as O
2. Enter numbers 1-9 to place your mark:

```
 1 | 2 | 3 
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6 
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9 
```

1. The AI will respond with its strategic move
2. Game continues until win or tie!

🧠 AI Strategy

The AI implements a three-tier decision algorithm:

1. Win: Complete three in a row if possible
2. Block: Prevent player from winning
3. Random: Choose optimal empty spot
